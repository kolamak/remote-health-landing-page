# Remote Health Landing Page – Project Solution

This is a complete landing page project designed and built with **React.js**, **React Icons**, and **Tailwind CSS**, inspired by modern telehealth platforms.  
It was created as my **Week 1 internship project at Axia Africa**.

The goal of the project was to clone an existing landing page from a provided **Figma design** and transform it into a **fully responsive** user interface while practicing advanced layout techniques, component organization, and real-world UI development.

The page includes multiple structured sections such as the home area, services, product, about, privacy policy, terms of service, FAQs, and a styled contact component — all matching the original Figma spacing and layout as closely as possible.

## Project Overview

The **Remote Health Landing Page** is designed to simulate a functional, modern healthcare website where users can:

- Connect with licensed medical professionals

- Receive digital prescriptions

The page was built from scratch using:

- **React.js** for component-based structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive layout
- **Figma** as the primary design reference

The objective was to deliver a clean, responsive, and professional UI that aligns with industry-level healthcare platforms.

### Sections Included

## What I Learned

This project helped me improve my front-end development skills in several areas:

### Accurate Figma-to-Code Conversion

Understanding spacing, alignment, typography, and layout translation.

### Advanced Tailwind Techniques

Including:

- Custom widths (`w-[427px]`)
- Custom line-heights (`leading-[170%]`)
- Responsive utilities (`md:text-2xl`, `lg:w-[50%]`)
- Grid and flexbox combinations
- Consistent spacing and border utilities

### React Component Structure

Breaking the UI into clean, reusable and maintainable components:

- Home
- Services
- Product
- About
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- FAQs
- Contact
- Routing handled with React Router for smooth navigation across pages

### Responsive Design Best Practices

- Scaling typography
- Adjusting grid layouts
- Managing spacing across breakpoints
- Switching from column → row layouts

This project strengthened my real-world UI/UX implementation skills using modern front-end tools.

## Continued Development

Going forward, I plan to:

- Build more Figma-to-React conversion projects
- Add animations and micro-interactions (Framer Motion)
- Implement design systems and reusable components
- Improve accessibility using ARIA roles and semantic HTML
- Expand this into a multi-page healthcare platform

---

## Useful Resources

- **Tailwind CSS Documentation** – for spacing, responsive utilities, and layout
- **React Icons** – for icon integration
- **Figma Design File** – structure and reference
- Previous Tailwind and React projects – for layout consistency

## Acknowledgments

This project represents a meaningful step in my growth as a developer.  
Building a complete landing page from a detailed Figma file helped me practice discipline, consistency, and problem-solving.

Every section taught me something new, and it reflects my ongoing journey toward becoming a stronger front-end engineer.

Special thanks to Axia Africa for the opportunity and to the tools and platforms that continue to shape my development path.
