# Remote Health Landing Page – 

A fully responsive landing page built with **React.js**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Icons**, and **React Router**, created as my **Week 1 internship project at Axia Africa**.  
The project involved cloning a Figma design and translating it into a real, production-ready interface with accurate spacing, responsiveness, and component structure.
