# Remote Health Landing Page – Project Solution

A fully responsive landing page built with **React.js**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Icons**, and **React Router**, created as my **Week 1 internship project at Axia Africa**.  
The project involved cloning a Figma design and translating it into a real, production-ready interface with accurate spacing, responsiveness, and component structure.

##  Project Overview

The landing page simulates a modern telehealth platform where users can:

- Connect with medical professionals  
- Book consultations  
- Access virtual assistance  
- Receive digital prescriptions  

The UI includes: Home, Services, Product, About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, FAQs, and Contact sections — all structured with React components and routed using React Router.
